## 🛠️ Scripts Created

### 1. **Product Extraction Script**

- **File:** `/scripts/extract-products.js`
- **Purpose:** Automatically extracts product metadata from page.tsx files
- **Output:** 72 products extracted (main + variants)

### 2. **Product Filter Script**

- **File:** `/scripts/filter-main-products.js`
- **Purpose:** Filters to only main product pages (excludes variants)
- **Output:** 20 main products identified

### 3. **Product Injection Script** (Updated)

- **File:** `/scripts/inject-migrated-products.js`
- **Purpose:** Injects products into target page.tsx files
- **Features:**
  - Handles `useMemo` wrapped arrays
  - Duplicate detection by slug
  - Automatic backups
  - Structure adaptation per target file
  - Detailed reporting

### 4. **Data Files Generated**

- `/scripts/extracted-products.json` - All 72 products
- `/scripts/main-products-filtered.json` - 20 main products
- `/scripts/main-products.ts.txt` - TypeScript array format

---

## 📁 Files Modified

### Primary Changes

## 📋 Data Structure Used

### For `/app/personal-finance/page.tsx`

```typescript
{
  title: string,              // Full product name with | KardTrust
  slug: string,               // URL-friendly identifier
  description: string,        // Product description/benefits
  image: string,              // Product card image URL
  date: string,               // "DD Month YYYY" format
  category: "creditCards"     // For filtering (all products)
}
```

---

## 🔄 Why Only `/app/personal-finance/page.tsx`?

1. **`/app/blog/page.tsx`** - Already has all 20 products ✅
2. **`/app/financial-solutions/page.tsx`** - Uses different array structure (loans vs cards)
3. **`/app/page.tsx`** (homepage) - Should be selective (featured products only)

**Result:** Focused injection on the one file that needed it most

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Injection

- **Personal Finance Page**: Had only personal finance articles
- **Financial Solutions Missing**: 20 credit card products not listed

### After Injection

- **Personal Finance Page**: Now includes all 20 financial solution products
- **Category Filter**: Products accessible via "Credit Cards" filter
- **Complete Catalog**: Users can discover all products from one location

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Update Homepage Featured Products (Optional)

If you want to feature any of the new products on the homepage:

```bash
# Manual edit of /app/page.tsx
# Replace featured products with latest offerings
```

### 2. Update Financial Solutions Page (Future)

The `/app/financial-solutions/page.tsx` uses a different structure with separate arrays for credit cards vs loans. If needed, we can:

- Create a separate injection for credit cards array
- Adapt the script for that specific structure

### 3. Blog Post Integration (Already Complete)

The blog page already has these products, so no action needed.

## 💡 How to Update in the Future

When new financial products are added:

1. **Add product page** to `/app/financial-solutions/[new-product]/page.tsx`
2. **Run extraction script**:

   ```bash
   node ./scripts/extract-products.js
   node ./scripts/filter-main-products.js
   ```

3. **Run injection script** (will auto-skip existing):

   ```bash
   node ./scripts/inject-migrated-products.js
   ```
