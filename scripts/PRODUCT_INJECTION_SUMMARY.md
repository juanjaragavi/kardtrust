### Missing Products to Complete 32 Total

According to the BudgetBee migration documentation, there should be **32 products total**. Currently, we have **20-21** financial solution products in the blog page.

**Action Needed**: Please provide the list of the remaining ~11-12 products that need to be added, or confirm if the current 20 products represent the complete migration.

## Script Capabilities

The injection script can:

✅ **Automatically inject** product data into multiple page.tsx files
✅ **Detect duplicates** to prevent re-adding existing products  
✅ **Format data** appropriately for each target file's structure
✅ **Create backups** before modifying files
✅ **Report progress** with detailed logging

## Target Files Configured

1. `/app/blog/page.tsx` - Main blog listing
2. `/app/personal-finance/page.tsx` - Personal finance archive
3. `/app/financial-solutions/page.tsx` - Financial solutions archive
4. `/app/page.tsx` - Homepage featured posts

## Different Data Structures Handled

The script adapts products to match each file's specific structure:

### Blog Structure (Simple)

```typescript
{
  title: string,
  slug: string,
  description: string,
  image: string,
  category: "Financial Solutions",
  categoryPath: "/financial-solutions",
  date: "DD Month YYYY"
}
```

### Personal Finance Structure

```typescript
{
  title: string,
  slug: string,
  description: string,
  image: string,
  date: "DD Month YYYY",
  category: "creditCards" // filtering category
}
```

### Financial Solutions Structure

```typescript
{
  title: string,
  slug: string,
  description: string,
  image: string,
  date: "DD Month YYYY",
  type: "traditional" | "fintech" | "neobank"
}
```

### Homepage Structure (Complex)

```typescript
{
  slug: string,
  frontmatter: {
    title: string,
    description: string,
    date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ",
    featuredImage: string,
    categories: [{ name: string, slug: string }]
  },
  category: string,
  categoryPath: string
}
```

## How to Use the Script

### 1. Verify Product List

First, confirm the complete list of 32 products to inject.

### 2. Update Script (if needed)

Add any missing products to the `MIGRATED_PRODUCTS` array in the script.

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
node ./scripts/inject-migrated-products.js
```

### 4. Review Output

The script will show:

- Number of products injected per file
- Number of products skipped (duplicates)
- Any errors encountered

### 5. Verify Changes

```bash
# Check syntax
npm run lint

# Build project
npm run build

# Test locally
npm run dev
```

### 6. Commit Changes

```bash
git add app/blog/page.tsx app/personal-finance/page.tsx ...
git commit -m "Inject migrated financial products into blog listings"
```

## Next Steps

**Option 1**: If the current 20 products are the complete set:

- Update the script's `MIGRATED_PRODUCTS` array to match the actual count
- Run the script to inject into other target files (personal-finance, financial-solutions, homepage)

**Option 2**: If there are 12 more products to add:

- Provide the product details for the remaining items
- I'll update the script with the complete list
- Then run injection across all target files

**Option 3**: Extract all Financial Solutions products from existing pages:

- I can scan the financial-solutions directory
- Extract all product page data
- Generate the complete product list automatically

## Files Created

1. `/scripts/inject-migrated-products.js` - Main injection script (executable)
2. `/scripts/INJECT_PRODUCTS_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
3. `/scripts/PRODUCT_INJECTION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Product Count**: Are there exactly 32 products or 20 products in the migration?
2. **Source of Truth**: Should I extract the product list from existing `financial-solutions/*/page.tsx` files?
3. **Scope**: Do we need to inject into all 4 target files, or just specific ones?

Please advise on the next steps!
