## 🎯 Brand Elements Checklist

## 🎨 Composition Checklist

**Ensure professional composition:**

- [ ] **Balance:** Asymmetric but visually balanced
- [ ] **Subject Position:** Not centered (rule of thirds applied)
- [ ] **Face Clearance:** Subject's face NOT obscured by graphics
- [ ] **Depth Layering:** Some elements behind subject, some in front
- [ ] **Visual Flow:** Arrows guide eye upward through composition

## 🔴 Red Flags - Reject If Present

**Automatic rejection criteria:**

- ❌ Wrong colors (approximations like #CC0000 or #0055FF)
- ❌ Arrows pointing sideways or downward
- ❌ Five-pointed stars or generic sparkles
- ❌ Subject's face obscured by graphics
- ❌ Cluttered composition (less than 30% breathing room)
- ❌ Old blue/green template graphics still visible
- ❌ Over-processed or unrealistic photography
- ❌ Gradients on vector elements
- ❌ More than 4 arrows or 6 stars
- ❌ Resolution below 1920x1080

---

## 📐 Size Reference Guide

**Visual size guide for vector elements:**

```bash
IMAGE WIDTH = 1920px (example)

ARROWS:
├─ Hero Arrow:    288-384px    (15-20% of width)  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
├─ Medium Arrow:  154-230px    (8-12% of width)   ▬▬▬▬▬▬
└─ Small Arrow:   77-115px     (4-6% of width)    ▬▬▬

STARS:
├─ Large Stars:   58-96px      (3-5% of width)    ✦  (large)
└─ Small Stars:   19-38px      (1-2% of width)    ✦ (small)
```

## 🌈 Color Verification Process

**Use this process to verify brand colors:**

1. **Open generated image** in browser or editor
2. **Use color picker tool** (browser DevTools, Photoshop, etc.)
3. **Sample arrow color** → Should read `#D72638` or `rgb(215, 38, 56)`
4. **Sample star color** → Should read `#003DA5` or `rgb(0, 61, 165)`
5. **If colors don't match exactly** → Request regeneration with emphasis:
   > "Use EXACT hex #D72638 and #003DA5. No approximations."

## 🔧 Common Adjustments Reference

**Quick fix requests for common issues:**

### Issue: Arrows too subtle

```
"Increase the size of the main arrow to 20% of image width and boost
opacity to 95%. Make the arrow more prominent and bold."
```

### Issue: Stars lack impact

```
"Enhance the glow effect on blue stars. Increase outer glow to 25px
at 35% opacity. Make stars more luminous and eye-catching."
```

### Issue: Composition cluttered

```
"Remove 1 arrow and 2 stars. Increase negative space to 50% of the
composition. Simplify the layout for better breathing room."
```

### Issue: Colors slightly off

```
"Use EXACT hex values: #D72638 for red arrows, #003DA5 for blue stars.
Do not approximate. Match these hex codes precisely."
```

### Issue: Arrows pointing wrong direction

```
"CRITICAL: ALL arrows must point upward at angles between 45° and 90°
from horizontal. No sideways or downward arrows. Regenerate with
correct upward direction."
```

### Issue: Wrong star shape

```
"Stars must be four-pointed (like compass or North Star), NOT
five-pointed stars. NOT generic sparkles. Regenerate with correct
four-pointed star design."
```

## 📝 Alt Text Template

**Use this template for accessibility:**

```

growth and trust"

Structure:
- Subject: "Confident woman" / "Professional woman" / "Young woman"
- Action: "holding credit card" / "using tablet" / "shopping with phone"
- Context: "outdoors at café" / "in modern office" / "on urban street"

2. **Use color picker immediately** after generation to verify colors
3. **Count elements** (arrows and stars) to ensure within limits
4. **Check from far away** to see if composition has breathing room
5. **Test at mobile size** to ensure elements aren't too small
6. **Read alt text aloud** to ensure it makes sense
7. **Compare to approved examples** for consistency
