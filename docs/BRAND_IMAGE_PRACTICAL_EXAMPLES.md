## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Reference**
   - Mention exact pose, expression, and environment details
   - Reference the original image's lighting direction
   - Describe the mood you want to preserve

2. **Emphasize Brand Colors**
   - Always include "EXACT hex #D72638" and "EXACT hex #003DA5"
   - Mention "no gradients" to avoid color drift
   - Request solid fills for consistency

3. **Guide Composition**
   - Specify percentage sizes (e.g., "18% of image width")
   - Mention specific quadrants (upper-left, lower-right, etc.)
   - Reference the breathing room requirement (40-50%)

4. **Iterate Strategically**
   - Start with the full prompt, get a baseline
   - Request specific adjustments (not complete regeneration)
   - Build on what works rather than starting over

5. **Save Variations**
   - Keep 2-3 versions of each image
   - A/B test different arrow placements
   - Compare star quantities (5 vs. 6 vs. 4)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Not specifying exact hex colors → colors drift
- ❌ Saying "upward arrows" without angle → arrows point sideways
- ❌ Forgetting breathing room → cluttered composition
- ❌ Not mentioning "four-pointed" → generic stars appear
- ❌ Requesting "similar colors" → brand inconsistency

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Stars look like five-pointed stars, not four-pointed"

**Fix:** Add to prompt: "CRITICAL: Four-pointed stars ONLY, like compass points or plus signs with diagonal extensions. NOT five-pointed stars. NOT generic sparkles."

### Issue: "Arrows are sideways or downward"

**Fix:** Add: "CRITICAL: ALL arrows must point upward at angles between 45° and 90° from horizontal. Upward direction is non-negotiable."

### Issue: "Colors don't match brand exactly"

**Fix:** Add: "Use EXACT hex values without approximation: #D72638 for red (not #CC0000 or similar), #003DA5 for blue (not #0055FF or similar)."

### Issue: "Composition feels cluttered"

**Fix:** Add: "CRITICAL: Maintain 40-50% negative space. Use MAXIMUM 4 arrows and 6 stars total. Less is more. Breathing room is essential."

### Issue: "Vector elements look pasted on, not integrated"

**Fix:** Add: "Elements must have depth layering with some behind subject, some in front. Add subtle drop shadows (2-4px, 20% opacity) to arrows. Vary element opacity between 85-95%."
