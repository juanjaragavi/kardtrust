## 🎓 Example Transformations

### Before & After Examples

#### **Example 1: Currency & Tax Terms**

_Before (UK):_

> "If you're earning over £30,000, you'll need to pay council tax of around £150 per month. Make sure to inform HMRC about any side income, as you may need to pay National Insurance contributions."

_After (US):_

> "If you're earning over $30,000, you'll need to pay property tax of around $150 per month. Make sure to register any side income with the appropriate tax authorities, as you may need to pay self-employment taxes."

#### **Example 2: Regulatory References**

_Before (UK):_

> "To find a reputable lender, check the FCA register at register.fca.org.uk. Look for reviews on Trustpilot or Feefo to ensure they're legitimate."

_After (US):_

> "To find a reputable lender, check if they're properly licensed in your state. Look for reviews on the Better Business Bureau to ensure they're legitimate."

#### **Example 3: Spelling & Currency**

_Before (UK):_

> "Organise your favourite credit cards by their cashback rates. Cards offering 1% per pound spent can really add up!"

_After (US):_

> "Organize your favorite credit cards by their cashback rates. Cards offering 1% per dollar spent can really add up!"
