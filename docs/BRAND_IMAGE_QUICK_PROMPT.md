## 📋 Three-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Select Reference

Choose one of your original template images (woman-with-credit-card, woman-with-tablet, etc.)

### Step 2: Customize Prompt

Add specific details about the reference:

- **Outdoor scene:** "Natural daylight, greenery background, outdoor café setting"
- **Office scene:** "Professional indoor setting, window light, business casual attire"
- **Urban scene:** "Street environment, shopping context, casual lifestyle"

### Step 3: Verify Output

Check that generated image has:

- ✅ Exact colors (#D72638 red, #003DA5 blue)
- ✅ No old template graphics
- ✅ Upward arrows (growth)
- ✅ Four-pointed stars (trust)
- ✅ Clean, professional composition

## 🎯 Common Adjustments

**If arrows are too subtle:**

> "Make the main red arrow larger and more prominent, positioned in the upper-right quadrant"

**If composition is cluttered:**

> "Reduce the number of vector elements to 2 arrows and 3 stars, increase negative space"

**If stars lack impact:**

> "Increase the glow effect on blue stars, make them more luminous and eye-catching"

**If depth is lacking:**

> "Layer arrows and stars with some behind the subject and others in front, create more dimensional depth"
