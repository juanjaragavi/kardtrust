## 🎨 Key Design Principles

### DO ✅

- Use exact hex values: `#D72638` (red), `#003DA5` (blue)
- Create upward-pointing arrows (growth metaphor)
- Use four-pointed stars (trust symbol)
- Maintain hyper-realistic photography quality
- Keep 40-50% breathing room in composition
- Layer vector elements for depth
- Balance asymmetrically
- Guide eye movement upward

### DON'T ❌

- Use off-brand colors or gradients
- Create downward or lateral arrows
- Obscure subject's face with graphics
- Clutter the composition
- Over-process photography
- Use generic star shapes
- Center everything symmetrically
- Forget the breathing room

- **Quick Guide:** `/docs/BRAND_IMAGE_QUICK_PROMPT.md`
- **Visual Specs:** `/docs/BRAND_VISUAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md`

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Generated arrows point sideways or downward  
**Solution:** Emphasize in prompt: "CRITICAL: All arrows must point upward at 45-90° angles representing financial growth"

**Issue:** Stars don't look like brand logo stars  
**Solution:** Clarify: "Four-pointed star like North Star or compass rose, NOT five-pointed star, NOT generic sparkle"

**Issue:** Colors don't match brand  
**Solution:** Always include exact hex in prompt: "Use EXACT hex #D72638 for red, #003DA5 for blue. Do not approximate."

**Issue:** Composition too cluttered  
**Solution:** Add to prompt: "CRITICAL: Maintain 40-50% negative space. Use maximum 4 arrows and 6 stars. Breathing room is essential."
