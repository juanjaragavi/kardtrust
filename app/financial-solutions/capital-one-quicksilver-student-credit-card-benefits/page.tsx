                1.5% Unlimited Cash Back: Earn on Every Purchase
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Capital One Quicksilver Student Credit Card offers an
                impressive 1.5% cash back on every purchase with no restrictions
                or rotating categories. This straightforward rewards structure
                makes it easy for students to earn on all their spending - from
                textbooks and dining to gas and entertainment.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                For example, spending $500 a month earns $7.50 in cash back -
                that's $90 annually that can be used for statement credits or
                direct deposits. Unlike many student cards that offer limited or
                tiered rewards, this card ensures every purchase contributes to
                your cash back earnings.
              </p>

                No Foreign Transaction Fees: Perfect for Study Abroad
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                One of the standout features for students is the absence of
                foreign transaction fees. Whether you're studying abroad for a
                semester or traveling internationally, you won't pay extra fees
                on purchases made outside the United States.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                This feature can save students significant money when traveling
                or studying internationally, where foreign transaction fees
                typically range from 2.7% to 3% per transaction. For a $1,000
                study abroad expense, you could save $30 in fees alone.

                Credit-Building Tools: Establish Strong Financial Habits
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Capital One mobile app provides excellent tools to help
                students build credit responsibly. Features include credit score
                monitoring, spending tracking, and budgeting tools that help
                students understand their financial habits and improve their
                credit profile.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Students can set up account alerts, monitor their credit
                utilization, and access educational resources about credit
                management. These tools are invaluable for young adults learning
                to manage credit responsibly and establish a strong financial
                foundation.

              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                As a student card, the Capital One Quicksilver Student Credit
                Card comes with no annual fee, making it an affordable option

                earned translate directly to savings without any ongoing costs.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Without an annual fee, students can focus on building credit and

              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The card includes special considerations for students, such as
                more flexible approval criteria for those with limited credit
                history. Capital One understands that students are just
                beginning their credit journey and may not have extensive credit
                backgrounds.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">

                education and tools specifically designed to help students learn
                good financial habits from the start of their credit-building
                journey.
