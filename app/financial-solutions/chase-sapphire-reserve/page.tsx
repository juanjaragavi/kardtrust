                  that extends well beyond typical rewards programs. The card's

                  Chase Ultimate Rewards points earned with the Sapphire
                  Reserve® deliver maximum flexibility and value. Redeem points
                  for travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal at 1.5
                  cents per point—significantly higher than the standard 1 cent
                  per point redemption value of most cards. A $1,000 flight
                  would cost just 66,667 points instead of 100,000 points with
                  standard redemption. Alternatively, transfer points at a 1:1
                  ratio to 14+ airline and hotel loyalty programs including
                  United MileagePlus, Southwest Rapid Rewards, Marriott Bonvoy,
                  World of Hyatt, British Airways Executive Club, Air Canada
                  Aeroplan, Emirates Skywards, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer,
                  Virgin Atlantic Flying Club, IHG Rewards, and JetBlue
                  TrueBlue. Strategic transfers often yield values of 2-3 cents
                  per point or higher when redeemed for premium cabin flights or
                  luxury hotel stays. You can also use points for cash back at 1
                  cent per point, statement credits against purchases, gift
                  cards, shopping through the Chase portal, or experiences

                  The Sapphire Reserve® provides robust purchase protections
                  that safeguard your investments. Purchase protection covers
                  eligible purchases against damage or theft for 120 days after
                  purchase (up to $10,000 per claim and $50,000 per account
                  annually). Extended warranty protection automatically extends
                  the manufacturer's warranty by an additional year on
                  warranties of three years or less, providing peace of mind on
                  electronics, appliances, and other purchases. Return
                  protection allows you to return eligible purchases that
                  merchants won't take back within 90 days of purchase (up to
                  $500 per item, $1,000 per year). These benefits effectively
                  function as complimentary insurance policies that save
                  hundreds of dollars on potential losses, disputes, or repair
                  costs throughout the year.

                  The Chase Sapphire Reserve® delivers maximum value for
                  specific consumer profiles. You'll benefit most if you travel
                  domestically or internationally at least 3-4 times annually,
                  regularly dine at restaurants (including takeout and
                  delivery), value airport lounge access and travel
                  conveniences, want comprehensive travel insurance without
                  purchasing separate policies, appreciate luxury travel perks
                  and concierge services, have good to excellent credit
                  (typically 720+ credit score), and can comfortably afford the
                  annual fee while maximizing the benefits. The card
                  particularly excels for business travelers who expense travel
                  and dining, families who take annual vacations and value
                  travel insurance, digital nomads and location-independent
                  professionals, and affluent consumers seeking prestige cards
                  with tangible benefits.

                  Conversely, this card may not suit you if you travel
                  infrequently (1-2 times per year or less), rarely dine at
                  restaurants preferring home-cooked meals, have limited credit
                  history or fair credit scores, prefer simple cash back without
                  redemption complexity, or cannot comfortably afford the $550
                  annual fee. In these cases, consider alternatives like the
                  Chase Sapphire Preferred® (lower annual fee), Chase Freedom
                  Unlimited® (no annual fee cash back), or other travel cards
                  with different fee structures.

                  you make $10,000 in purchases with an APR of 25% and make only
                  minimum payments, you will pay approximately $3,200 in
                  interest over approximately 12 years before the balance is
                  paid off. Your actual APR, interest charges, and payoff period
                  will vary based on your creditworthiness and payment behavior.
                  To avoid interest charges, pay your full statement balance by
                  the due date each month.

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Important Risk Warnings:</strong> Credit cards are a
                  form of borrowing. Missing payments can damage your credit
                  score and result in late fees and penalty APRs. Only borrow
                  what you can afford to repay. High interest rates can make
                  minimum payments expensive—always aim to pay more than the
                  minimum. This card is best suited for consumers who pay their
                  balance in full each month to avoid interest charges, as the
                  high APR can negate the value of rewards earned if you carry a
                  balance.
