                Requirements for the Citi Double Cash Credit Card
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                To apply for the Citi Double Cash Credit Card, ensure you meet
                the following general criteria:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit Score:</strong> A good credit score of at least
                  670 is generally recommended to improve your chances of
                  approval. A strong credit history demonstrates your ability to
                  manage credit responsibly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> Applicants must be 18 years
                  or older to legally qualify for a credit card in the United
                  States.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Security Number (SSN):</strong> An SSN is
                  required for identity verification and to comply with federal
                  regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Income Documentation:</strong> Proof of income or
                  employment details is often necessary. This helps Citi assess
                  your financial capacity to handle new credit and determine
                  your credit limit.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Step 2: Provide Personal Details:</strong> Complete

                  rates, fees, and the specifics of the rewards program.

                  though some may require additional review.

                The Citi Double Cash Credit Card offers several compelling

                  <strong>1. Straightforward Cash-Back Rewards:</strong> This
                  card offers a unique and simple cash-back structure: earn 1%
                  cash back when you make a purchase, and another 1% when you
                  pay for that purchase. This encourages timely payments and
                  provides consistent rewards without complex categories.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2. No Annual Fee:</strong> Enjoy all the benefits of
                  the card without the burden of an annual fee. This ensures
                  that every dollar of cash back you earn is pure savings.
                </li>

                  <strong>3. Versatile Redemption Options:</strong> Citi
                  provides flexible ways to redeem your cash-back rewards. You
                  can choose to apply them as a statement credit, receive a
                  direct deposit into your bank account, or even get a check by
                  mail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>4. Balance Transfer Feature:</strong> The card
                  includes an introductory APR offer on balance transfers, which
                  can be highly beneficial for consolidating and paying down
                  existing high-interest debt. (Note: A balance transfer fee
                  typically applies.)

                  <strong>Use for Everyday Expenses:</strong> Consistently use

                <li>
                  <strong>Pay Your Balance in Full:</strong> To fully leverage
                  the 2% cash back and avoid interest charges, aim to pay your
                  statement balance in full each month. The "1% when you pay"
                  feature directly rewards this responsible behavior.
