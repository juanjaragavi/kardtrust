                The Citi Simplicity Card is designed for those who want

                No Late Fees, Ever: Freedom from Financial Penalties
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Citi Simplicity Card's standout feature is its commitment to
                never charging late fees, regardless of how many times you might
                miss a payment deadline. This unique benefit provides
                unprecedented peace of mind for cardholders who want to manage
                their finances without the stress of potential penalty charges.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Unlike traditional credit cards that can impose late fees
                ranging from $25 to $40 or more, the Citi Simplicity Card
                eliminates this concern entirely. This means you can focus on
                building better payment habits without the fear of accumulating
                additional debt through penalty fees. Whether you're dealing
                with irregular income, busy schedules, or simply want the
                security of knowing you won't be penalized for occasional late
                payments, this feature provides valuable financial flexibility.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                This benefit is particularly valuable for students, freelancers,
                or anyone with variable income who might occasionally struggle
                with payment timing but wants to maintain good credit standing.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                No Penalty APR: Your Rate Stays Consistent
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Beyond eliminating late fees, the Citi Simplicity Card also
                promises no penalty APR increases. This means your interest rate
                will never be raised as punishment for late payments or other
                account behaviors that might trigger penalty rates on other
                cards.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Traditional credit cards often implement penalty APRs that can
                jump to 29.99% or higher when cardholders miss payments, making
                debt recovery much more difficult. The Citi Simplicity Card's
                approach ensures your APR remains stable and predictable,
                helping you maintain control over your debt and payment
                strategy.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                This consistency in rates makes it easier to plan your finances
                and creates a more forgiving environment for those working to
                improve their credit management skills. You can focus on paying
                down balances without worrying about sudden rate increases that
                could derail your progress.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                0% Intro APR for 21 Months: Time to Breathe and Plan
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Citi Simplicity Card offers an exceptionally generous 0%
                introductory APR period of 21 months on both purchases and
                balance transfers. This extended promotional period provides
                substantial time to manage large expenses or consolidate
                existing debt without accruing interest charges.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                For balance transfers, this means you can move high-interest
                debt from other cards and have nearly two years to pay it down
                without additional interest accumulation. This can result in
                significant savings—if you transfer $5,000 from a card charging
                24% APR, you could save over $2,000 in interest charges during
                the promotional period.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                For new purchases, the 21-month 0% APR period allows you to make
                large necessary purchases—like appliances, furniture, or
                emergency expenses—and spread payments over time without
                interest charges. This flexibility can be particularly valuable
                for major life events, home improvements, or unexpected expenses
                that might otherwise strain your budget.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                No Annual Fee: Maximum Value, Minimal Cost
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Citi Simplicity Card comes with no annual fee, ensuring that
                all the benefits you receive don't come at the cost of yearly
                charges. This makes the card accessible to a broader range of
                consumers and ensures that the money you save from avoided fees
                and promotional rates translates directly to your bottom line.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Without an annual fee, you can keep the card open indefinitely
                to maintain your credit history and available credit, even if
                your usage patterns change over time. This long-term flexibility
                supports your overall credit health and financial planning
                goals.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                Perfect for Debt Consolidation and Large Purchases
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The combination of no fees, no penalty rates, and an extended 0%
                APR period makes the Citi Simplicity Card an excellent choice
                for debt consolidation. You can transfer balances from multiple
                high-interest cards and focus on paying down the principal
                without worrying about additional fees or rate increases.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                For large purchases, the card provides a practical way to spread
                costs over time without the burden of immediate interest
                charges. This makes it ideal for planned expenses like wedding
                costs, medical procedures, or home improvements where you need
                financing flexibility.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                Simplicity in Credit Management
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Citi Simplicity Card lives up to its name by removing the
                common complications and frustrations associated with credit
                card ownership. By eliminating late fees and penalty rates while
                providing an extended promotional period, it creates a more
                forgiving and manageable credit experience.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                This approach makes it particularly suitable for those who are
                new to credit, rebuilding their credit, or simply want a
                straightforward card without complex rewards structures or
                hidden fees. The card's simplicity doesn't mean sacrificing
                value—it means focusing on the fundamental benefits that matter
                most for everyday credit management.
              </p>
