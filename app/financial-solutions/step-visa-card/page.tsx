                completely free and accessible to teens as young as 13 years old

                no credit score, charges no fees, and has zero interest because
                it's a secured card backed by your Step account balance. Build

                  The Step Visa Card represents a fundamental shift in how young
                  people access credit building opportunities. Traditional
                  credit cards create a catch-22: you need credit history to get
                  approved for a credit card, but you need a credit card to
                  build credit history. Step breaks this cycle by offering a
                  secured Visa card that requires no credit history, no income
                  verification, and no credit checks—making it accessible to
                  anyone with a valid U.S. Social Security Number and bank
                  account.

                  How Step's Credit Building Actually Works
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Step Visa Card is a secured card, which means it's backed
                  by funds in your Step account rather than a line of credit.
                  When you make a purchase, money is deducted directly from your
                  account balance—similar to a debit card. However, unlike a
                  debit card, Step reports your purchase activity as positive
                  payment history to all three major credit bureaus (TransUnion,
                  Experian, and Equifax). Each time you use your Step card and
                  maintain your account in good standing, you're building credit
                  history automatically.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  This secured card structure eliminates the risk of debt and
                  interest charges that plague traditional credit cards. You can
                  only spend money you actually have in your account, preventing
                  overspending and debt accumulation. There's no APR because
                  you're not borrowing money—you're using your own funds while
                  Step reports this activity to credit bureaus as if it were a
                  traditional credit card. This makes Step ideal for learning
                  financial responsibility without the dangers of accumulating
                  high-interest credit card debt.

                  Starting Credit Building as a Teen
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  One of Step's most revolutionary features is enabling credit
                  building for teens starting at age 13. With a sponsor
                  (typically a parent or legal guardian), teens can open a Step
                  account and begin building up to two years of credit history
                  before turning 18. This gives young people a massive advantage
                  when they reach adulthood—imagine starting college or your
                  first job with an established credit history and score already
                  in the 700s.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The sponsorship model gives parents oversight and control
                  while teaching financial literacy. Sponsors can monitor
                  spending, receive transaction notifications, set spending
                  limits, and approve certain purchases. Teens gain real-world
                  experience managing money and building credit under parental
                  guidance. When the teen turns 18, they can continue using
                  their Step account independently, taking their established
                  credit history into adulthood. For younger children under 13,
                  Step offers parent- managed accounts that don't yet report to
                  credit bureaus but teach money management fundamentals.

                  Step's credit building effectiveness is backed by independent
                  research from TransUnion, one of the three major credit
                  bureaus. Analysis of 594 Step users ages 21-27 showed an
                  average credit score improvement of 57 points within a 360-day
                  period. Many users report even more dramatic
                  improvements—testimonials include score increases of 85
                  points, 100+ points, and users reaching scores of 700+ within
                  their first year.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Step users also demonstrate above-average initial credit
                  scores compared to national averages for their age group. The
                  median credit score when Step's trade line is first reported
                  is 721— significantly higher than the national average for
                  young adults in their late teens and early 20s. TransUnion
                  data shows Step users ages 17-20 have credit scores averaging
                  higher than the national average for their age group,
                  demonstrating the power of starting credit building early with
                  Step's secured card approach.

                  Maintaining sufficient funds to cover purchases and avoiding
                  account violations is essential for building credit. Step has
                  no control over credit scores generated by credit bureaus—your
