                      means your application won't result in a hard inquiry on
                      your credit report, making it ideal for those with limited
                      or damaged credit history.

                      Unlike most traditional secured credit cards that charge

                      Builder Card has absolutely no annual fee. This means you

                      With Chime's automatic payment system, missed payments are
                      rare because your balance is automatically paid from your
                      secured deposit at the end of each month. However, if you
                      don't maintain sufficient funds in your secured deposit
                      account, you may face payment issues. Late payments may
                      negatively impact your credit score, which is why
                      maintaining adequate funds is important.

                  On-time payment history may have a positive impact on your
                  credit score, while late payments may negatively impact your
                  score. Chime reports your activities to TransUnion, Experian,
                  and Equifax. Impact on your credit may vary, as credit scores
                  are independently determined by credit bureaus based on
                  numerous factors including the financial decisions you make
                  with other financial services organizations.

                  The Chime Credit Builder Visa Secured Card has no APR or
                  interest charges because you're using your own money from your
                  secured deposit rather than borrowing. Traditional credit
                  cards may have APRs ranging from 15% to 29.99% or higher. For
                  example, if you carried a $1,000 balance on a traditional card
                  with 20% APR for one year, you could pay approximately $200 in
                  interest. With the Chime Credit Builder Card, you would pay $0
                  in interest on the same balance.
