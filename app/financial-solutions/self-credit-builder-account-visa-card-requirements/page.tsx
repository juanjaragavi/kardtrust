              Self Financial pairs its Credit Builder Account with the secured
              Self Visa Credit Card to help consumers establish installment and
              revolving credit history. Meeting the eligibility criteria
              requires consistent payments, identity verification, and a
              refundable $100 security interest before the card can be
              activated. Use this guide to understand what Self expects as you
              progress from the savings-backed loan to the Visa card.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-5">
                Self shares a representative example for the $35 plan: 24
                monthly payments at 15.69% APR result in $840 paid, $123 in
                finance charges, and $717 returned when the account reaches
                maturity in good standing. For the Self Visa Credit Card,
                pricing includes a $0 annual fee in the first year, a $25 annual
                fee after the introductory period, a 27.99% variable APR, a
                $3.50 instant debit funding fee, and late or returned payment
                fees up to $15. Paying the card statement balance in full each
                month avoids interest and protects the $100 security interest
                you have built.

                Carrying a $1,000 balance on the card for 12 months at 27.99%
                APR with only minimum payments could generate approximately $279
                in interest charges. This example illustrates why the Consumer
                Financial Protection Bureau recommends paying more than the
                minimum whenever possible.

                  Yes. Self confirms in its pricing FAQ that payments are
                  reported to Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion each month.

                  Yes. Self states that you can close or pay off the account
                  early without penalty, although the amount returned may be
                  lower if you exit before maturity.

                  Self advertises that the card does not rely on a traditional
                  credit check. Instead, eligibility is based on your account
                  performance, savings progress, and an income and expense
                  review.

                  Self warns that missing payments may result in delinquent
                  credit bureau reporting and could reduce the funds you receive
                  back from your Credit Builder Account. Contact support at

                The Credit Builder Account and Visa card are offered through

                <span className="font-semibold">Risk warning:</span> Missing
                monthly minimum payments may result in delinquent reporting to
                the credit bureaus and can reduce the security deposit or
                savings returned at the end of the term. Fees may also reduce
                the refundable deposit. Always borrow responsibly and review
                Self's current disclosures before applying.
