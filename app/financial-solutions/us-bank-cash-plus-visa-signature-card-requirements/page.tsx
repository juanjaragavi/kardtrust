                Before beginning your application, it’s important to ensure you
                meet the eligibility criteria. These requirements are essential
                for improving your chances of approval and avoiding unnecessary
                delays.

                <li>
                  <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least 18
                  years old to apply for the US Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card.
                  This is a standard requirement across most credit card issuers
                  to comply with legal and financial regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>U.S. Residency:</strong> This card is only available
                  to U.S. residents. You’ll need to provide a valid U.S. mailing
                  address during the application process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Security Number (SSN):</strong> A valid Social
                  Security Number is required. This will be used for the
                  necessary credit checks and identity verification.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit Score:</strong> US Bank typically requires a
                  good to excellent credit score, generally starting at 670 or
                  above. A higher score increases your chances of approval and
                  may provide better terms, such as higher credit limits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Income Requirement:</strong> While US Bank doesn’t
                  specify a minimum income, you’ll need to demonstrate a steady
                  and sufficient income to cover potential credit card debts.
                  Higher income levels may improve your approval odds and credit
                  terms.
