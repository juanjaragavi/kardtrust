              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                To apply for the Discover it Student Chrome Credit Card, you
                generally need to meet the following criteria:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> Applicants must be at least
                  18 years old to apply for this credit card. This is a standard
                  requirement across most credit card issuers to comply with
                  legal and financial regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>U.S. Residency:</strong> The card is exclusively
                  available to U.S. residents, meaning you need a valid
                  residential address within the United States. If you do not
                  have a permanent address in the U.S., your application will
                  not be considered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Student Enrollment:</strong> As this is a
                  student-specific credit card, being currently enrolled in a
                  college or university is mandatory. You must already be
                  attending classes; an acceptance letter alone will not be
                  sufficient proof of enrollment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Proof of Income or Financial Support:</strong>{" "}
                  Although designed for students who may have limited earnings,
                  Discover requires applicants to demonstrate their ability to
                  manage repayments. This can be shown through:
                </li>
              </ul>
              - A personal income source, such as earnings from part-time jobs,
              freelance work, or internships. - Financial support, such as
              allowances from family or scholarships. Even if your income is
              modest, having a reliable source of funds is crucial.
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit History:</strong> While this card is suitable
                  for individuals with limited or no credit history, having some
                  existing credit history (for example, as an authorized user on
                  a parent’s credit card) can strengthen your application. If
                  you currently lack credit history, demonstrating responsible
                  financial habits in other areas is essential.

                  need to disclose your income sources. Discover understands

              </ul>
              - Earnings from part-time or freelance work. - Allowances or

                  <strong>Step 4: Review and Submit Your Application:</strong>{" "}
                  Double-check all your details to ensure accuracy. Any errors

                  verified, submit your application. Discover typically provides
                  an instant decision, though some applications may require
