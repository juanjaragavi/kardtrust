                      The Avant Credit Card is specifically designed for
                      consumers with fair credit or those building/rebuilding
                      their credit history. While Avant doesn't publish a
                      minimum credit score requirement, the card is positioned
                      for consumers who may not qualify for traditional rewards
                      cards or premium credit products. Your credit profile will
                      be evaluated during the application process, but checking
                      if you qualify won't impact your credit score—only the
                      formal application after pre-qualification will involve a
                      hard credit inquiry.

                      You'll need to provide information about your income
                      during the application process. Avant evaluates your
                      ability to repay based on your stated income, existing
                      debts, and credit profile. Acceptable income sources
                      typically include employment wages, self-employment
                      income, retirement benefits, investment income, or other
                      regular income streams. The income verification helps
                      Avant determine an appropriate credit limit and ensure you
                      can manage the credit card payments responsibly.

                      prevent fraud and ensure applicants are who they claim to

                      your Avant Credit Card. While you can make payments
                      through various methods including the mobile app, online
                      banking, phone payments, or mailed checks, having a linked
                      bank account simplifies automatic payments and helps
                      ensure you never miss a due date. Setting up automatic
                      minimum payments from your bank account can protect your
                      credit score by preventing late payment reports to credit
                      bureaus.

                    This example illustrates why paying more than the minimum
                    payment is crucial. At 35.99% APR, interest charges
                    accumulate quickly. Paying your balance in full each month
                    avoids interest charges entirely and maximizes the card's
                    credit-building benefits.

                    Does checking if I qualify impact my credit score?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 text-left">
                    No, checking if you qualify for the Avant Credit Card uses a
                    soft credit check that does not affect your credit score.
                    Only when you proceed with the full application after
                    pre-qualifying will Avant perform a hard credit inquiry,
                    which may temporarily impact your credit score. This
                    pre-qualification process allows you to see if you're
                    eligible and view potential terms before formally applying.

                    Avant doesn't publish a specific minimum credit score
                    requirement, but the card is designed for consumers with
                    fair credit or those building/rebuilding their credit.
                    Generally, fair credit ranges from approximately 580-669 on
                    the FICO scale. However, Avant evaluates multiple factors
                    beyond just credit score, including income, debt-to-income
                    ratio, and credit history. The best way to know if you
                    qualify is to check your eligibility on Avant's website.

                    How is the Avant Credit Card different from a secured card?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 text-left">
                    The Avant Credit Card is an unsecured card, meaning you
                    don't need to provide a security deposit to open the
                    account. Secured cards typically require you to deposit
                    $200-$500 or more, which serves as collateral and usually
                    equals your credit limit. With the Avant Credit Card, your
                    approved credit limit (ranging from $300-$3,000) is
                    available to use immediately without tying up your cash in a
                    deposit. However, the card does have an annual membership
                    fee, which secured cards may not have.

                    Can I get a credit line increase with the Avant Credit Card?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 text-left">
                    Yes, Avant proactively monitors accounts and may offer
                    credit line increases to qualifying cardholders who
                    demonstrate responsible credit management. If you qualify
                    for a higher credit limit, Avant will notify you—you don't
                    need to request increases manually. Factors that may help
                    you qualify for increases include consistent on-time
                    payments, maintaining low credit utilization, and overall
                    positive credit management over time.

                    What happens if I pay late or miss a payment?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 text-left">
                    Late or missed payments can have serious consequences. Avant
                    reports payment activity to the major credit bureaus, so
                    late payments may negatively impact your credit score. You
                    may also incur late fees and penalty APR increases. To avoid
                    these issues, set up payment reminders in the Avant mobile
                    app or consider enrolling in automatic payments to ensure
                    your minimum payment is always made on time. Timely payments
                    are crucial for building positive credit history.

                    The Avant Credit Card is issued by WebBank, a Utah-chartered
                    industrial bank that partners with fintech companies like
                    Avant to offer credit products. Avant, LLC (Nationwide
                    Multistate Licensing System #1246731) is the servicer and
                    handles customer service, account management, and
                    collections. The card operates on the Mastercard network,
                    giving you acceptance at millions of locations worldwide.
                    WebBank is the actual creditor, while Avant manages the
                    customer experience.
