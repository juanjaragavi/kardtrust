                The Robinhood Gold Card offers exceptional rewards with 3% cash
                back on all purchases, but it has specific eligibility
                requirements. Beyond standard credit qualifications, applicants
                must maintain an active Robinhood Gold membership and Robinhood
                Financial brokerage account. This guide details everything you
                need to know about qualifying for and applying for the Robinhood

                      your card. The Gold membership costs $5/month or $50/year
                      (saving $10 annually). This membership includes 3% APY on
                      uninvested cash, professional research from Morningstar,
                      Level II market data (Nasdaq TotalView), margin investing,
                      and larger instant deposits. If you're not already a Gold
                      member, you'll need to subscribe before applying for the
                      card. Canceling your Gold membership may result in
                      suspension of your credit card account.

                      You must have an active Robinhood Financial brokerage
                      account in good standing. This account is necessary to
                      redeem cash back rewards, which are deposited directly
                      into your brokerage as cash. The brokerage account must be
                      fully opened and verified before you can apply for the
                      credit card. Both your Gold membership and brokerage
                      account must remain active to continue using the card and
                      accessing rewards. If you don't already have a Robinhood
                      brokerage account, opening one is free and typically takes
                      5-10 minutes.

                      While Robinhood doesn't publicly specify minimum credit
                      score requirements, the Gold Card typically requires good
                      to excellent credit for approval. Generally, applicants
                      with FICO scores of 670 or higher have the best approval
                      odds, though some with lower scores may be approved based
                      on other factors. Your credit history, income, existing
                      debt levels, and recent credit inquiries all influence the
                      approval decision. Robinhood performs a "soft" credit
                      check during pre-qualification that won't impact your
                      score, but accepting an offer triggers a "hard" inquiry.

                      You must provide verifiable income information during
                      application. The credit card issuer (Coastal Community
                      Bank) evaluates your income against your existing debt
                      obligations to ensure you can reasonably manage credit
                      card payments. Acceptable income sources include
                      employment wages, self-employment income, investment
                      income, rental property income, retirement distributions,
                      Social Security benefits, and alimony or child support. If
                      you're 21 or older, you can include household income you
                      have reasonable access to. Documentation may be requested
                      to verify income claims.

                      Applicants should not have recent bankruptcies,
                      foreclosures, or charge-offs on their credit report. A
                      history of missed payments, high credit utilization, or
                      defaulted accounts significantly reduces approval chances.
                      Additionally, issues in ChexSystems (a consumer reporting
                      agency for banking) such as unpaid overdrafts, bounced
                      checks, or closed accounts due to fraud may impact your
                      ability to open the required Robinhood brokerage account.
                      Maintaining good standing across both credit and banking
                      systems is important for approval.

                higher than many credit cards on the market. This rate is

                Robinhood Gold Card is best used as a "pay in full every month"
                rewards card. With 3% cash back on all purchases, the card
                provides excellent value when paid off monthly. However,
                carrying a balance quickly negates rewards due to the high APR.
                If you anticipate needing to carry balances, consider cards with
                lower APRs or promotional 0% APR offers for balance transfers.

                    score. You'll receive an instant decision about whether
                    you're pre-qualified and what credit limit range you might
                    receive. Pre-qualification doesn't guarantee approval but
                    indicates strong likelihood.

                    complete personal information, income details, housing

                    triggers a hard credit inquiry that will appear on your
                    credit report and may temporarily lower your score by a few
                    points. The application typically takes 5-10 minutes to

                    business days. While waiting, you can activate a digital
                    card number immediately for online purchases or add it to
                    Apple Pay/Google Pay. Once your physical card arrives,

                  Dispute any inaccuracies that could hurt your approval
                  chances. Also, avoid applying for multiple credit cards within
                  a short period, as numerous hard inquiries can negatively
                  impact your credit score and approval odds.

                    While Robinhood doesn't publish minimum credit score
                    requirements, the Gold Card generally requires good to
                    excellent credit for approval. Most successful applicants
                    have FICO scores of 670 or higher. Applicants with scores in
                    the 740+ range typically have the highest approval rates and
                    receive better credit limits. Your overall credit profile—
                    including payment history, credit utilization, length of
                    credit history, and recent inquiries—also influences the
                    decision beyond just your score.

                    No, you must have an active Robinhood Financial brokerage
                    account before applying for the Gold Card. However, opening
                    a brokerage account is free and typically takes only 5-10
                    minutes. You'll need to complete identity verification,
                    which usually processes instantly but can take up to 1-2
                    business days. Once your brokerage account is verified,
                    subscribe to Robinhood Gold ($5/month), then apply for the
                    credit card. You don't need to fund your brokerage account
                    to apply for the card, though cash back rewards are
                    deposited there.

                    Maintaining an active Robinhood Gold membership is required

                    support to understand the specific implications for your
                    card. You would need to pay off any outstanding balance and

                    purchases. Your physical stainless steel card ships within

                    Credit limits vary widely based on individual
                    creditworthiness, income, existing debt, and other factors
                    evaluated during underwriting. Initial credit limits
                    typically range from $500 to $10,000+ for most approved
                    applicants. High credit score applicants with strong income
                    and low debt may receive limits of $15,000 or higher. Your
                    pre-qualification offer will show an estimated credit limit
                    range. After account opening, you can request credit limit

                    The pre-qualification step uses a soft credit inquiry that

                    the offer and submit a full application, Robinhood Credit
                    performs a hard inquiry that will appear on your credit
                    report and may temporarily lower your score by approximately
                    5-10 points. This impact is typically minor and
                    temporary—scores usually recover within a few months with
                    continued responsible credit use. Hard inquiries remain on
                    your credit report for 2 years but generally only affect
                    scores for about 12 months.
