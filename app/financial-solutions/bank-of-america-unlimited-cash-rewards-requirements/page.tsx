                      The Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards card
                      typically requires a credit score of 690 or higher for
                      approval, though many approved applicants have scores in
                      the 720+ range. Bank of America evaluates your FICO®
                      Score and comprehensive credit report from major credit
                      bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) to assess
                      creditworthiness. A strong credit history demonstrates
                      responsible credit management including consistent on-time
                      payments, low credit utilization (ideally under 30% of
                      available credit limits), a reasonable number of credit
                      inquiries, and a healthy mix of credit accounts (credit
                      cards, auto loans, mortgages, etc.). Before applying,
                      review your credit reports for accuracy at
                      AnnualCreditReport.com and dispute any errors that could
                      negatively impact your application.

                      You must be at least 18 years old to apply independently
                      (or 21 in some states per state law requirements).
                      Applicants aged 18-20 must demonstrate independent income
                      or have a creditworthy co-signer in states that allow it.
                      You must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident with a
                      green card, or have valid work authorization with a U.S.
                      residential address. International students with valid
                      student visas and Social Security Numbers may qualify if
                      they meet other eligibility requirements and can
                      demonstrate sufficient income. Bank of America requires a
                      valid Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer
                      Identification Number (ITIN) for identity verification and

                      While Bank of America doesn't publish a specific minimum
                      income requirement, you must demonstrate verifiable income
                      sufficient to manage credit responsibly and make required
                      minimum payments. Most approved applicants report annual
                      incomes of $25,000 or higher, though income requirements
                      vary based on your overall financial profile, existing
                      debt obligations, and housing costs. You may report total
                      household income if you're at least 21 years old and have
                      reasonable access to those funds (such as spousal income),
                      which can strengthen your application if your personal
                      income is modest. Bank of America evaluates your
                      debt-to-income ratio—your total monthly debt payments
                      divided by monthly income—to ensure you can comfortably
                      handle additional credit.

                      Bank of America carefully reviews your credit history for
                      negative marks including recent late payments (especially
                      30+ days late), charge-offs, collections, bankruptcies,
                      foreclosures, or repossessions. Recent negative marks
                      significantly reduce approval odds, while older negative
                      items (7+ years) have diminishing impact as positive
                      payment history accumulates. If you have recent negative
                      marks, consider waiting 6-12 months while building
                      positive payment history before applying to improve
                      approval chances and secure better APR terms.

                      credit limits across all cards, with under 10% being
                      ideal. High utilization signals financial stress and
                      reduces approval odds even if you pay balances in full
                      monthly. For example, if you have $10,000 in total credit
                      limits across all cards, keep combined balances below
                      $3,000 (30%) or ideally under $1,000 (10%) when applying.
                      Pay down existing balances before applying to present the

                      investment account) may strengthen your application. Bank
                      of America can evaluate your banking behavior, account
                      history, and relationship tenure when assessing credit
                      applications. However, many applicants are approved
                      without prior Bank of America accounts if they meet other
                      eligibility criteria. Opening a checking or savings
                      account before applying may improve approval odds for

                      18 billing cycles from account opening (a substantial
                      promotional period). After the intro period ends, variable
                      purchase APR of 19.24% - 29.24% applies based on your
                      creditworthiness at approval. Your specific APR within

                      income, and overall financial profile. Balance transfer

                      rates are variable and can increase based on changes to

                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Credit cards are a form of
                  borrowing that must be managed responsibly. Missing payments
                  can severely damage your credit score, result in late fees up
                  to $40, trigger penalty APRs up to 29.99%, and create
                  long-term financial difficulties. The Bank of America®
                  Unlimited Cash Rewards card carries interest rates of 19.24% -
                  29.24% variable APR after the intro period—these rates can
                  quickly negate the value of cash back rewards if you carry
                  balances month-to-month. Only apply for this card if you can
                  commit to paying your balance in full each month to avoid
                  interest charges and maximize the value of the 1.5% cash back
                  rewards. The card works best for consumers with stable income,
                  good to excellent credit, and disciplined spending habits.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Credit Impact:</strong> Applying for any credit card
                  generates a hard inquiry on your credit report, which may
                  temporarily lower your credit score by a few points. Opening a
                  new account also reduces your average age of accounts, which
                  can impact your score. However, responsible use of the card
                  (consistent on-time payments, low utilization, avoiding maxing
                  out the card) typically improves your credit score over time.
                  Only apply if you genuinely need the card and meet the
                  eligibility criteria—avoid speculative applications that
                  create unnecessary hard inquiries.

                    Representative APR Example (Required by TILA):
                  </strong>{" "}
                  If you charge $10,000 in purchases at an APR of 24% and make
                  only minimum payments, you will pay approximately $3,200 in
                  interest charges over approximately 12 years before the
                  balance is fully paid off. Your actual APR, interest charges,
                  and payoff period depend on your creditworthiness, payment
                  behavior, and changes in the U.S. Prime Rate. To avoid
                  interest entirely, pay your full statement balance by the due
                  date each billing cycle. The 0% intro APR period provides an
                  opportunity to make purchases or transfer balances without
                  accruing interest for 18 billing cycles, but standard APR
                  applies to remaining balances after the promotional period
                  ends.

                  it's not a solution to overspending or poor financial habits.
                  The 3% balance transfer fee ($150 on a $5,000 transfer) adds
                  to the amount you owe. Only transfer balances if you have a
                  realistic plan to pay them down during the 18-month
                  promotional period. If you don't pay off the balance before
                  the intro period ends, standard APR applies to the remaining
                  balance, which could be higher than your original card's rate.
                  Use balance transfers strategically as part of a comprehensive
                  debt payoff plan, not as a way to avoid addressing underlying
                  spending issues.

                  <strong>Before Applying:</strong> Carefully consider whether
                  the Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards card aligns with
                  your financial situation, spending habits, and credit goals.
                  Evaluate whether you can realistically pay your balance in
                  full each month to avoid interest charges and maximize cash
                  back value. Review your credit report to ensure you meet
                  eligibility criteria and have no errors. Consider whether you
                  can qualify for Preferred Rewards benefits by maintaining
                  qualifying balances, as this significantly enhances the card's
                  value. If you're unsure whether this card is appropriate for
                  your circumstances, consider consulting with a financial
                  advisor.
