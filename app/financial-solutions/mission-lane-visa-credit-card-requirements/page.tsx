                      Mission Lane works with fair to good credit profiles,
                      typically accepting applicants with FICO scores ranging
                      from 580 to 700. The Silver Line Visa® (best for better
                      credit) generally requires credit scores in the
                      good-to-very-good range (670-740). The Green Line Visa®
                      (best for fair-to-good credit) accepts credit scores in
                      the fair range (580-670). The Secured Visa® (best for
                      establishing credit) accepts applicants with limited or no
                      credit history, including those with scores below 580.
                      Mission Lane considers your entire credit profile, not
                      just your score, so approval is possible even with past
                      credit challenges.

                      You must have a verifiable source of income to demonstrate
                      your ability to make monthly payments. Acceptable income
                      sources include employment income (salary, wages, hourly
                      pay), self-employment income, Social Security benefits,
                      disability income, retirement income, investment income,
                      or alimony/child support. If you're under 21, the Credit
                      CARD Act requires that you have independent income or a
                      co-signer. Mission Lane may verify your income through pay
                      stubs, tax returns, bank statements, or third-party
                      databases.

                      Mission Lane will review applicants with past
                      bankruptcies, but the bankruptcy should be discharged (not
                      active). Chapter 7 bankruptcies should be at least 2 years
                      old, and Chapter 13 bankruptcies should show a payment
                      plan in good standing or be fully discharged. If you have
                      accounts in collections, Mission Lane will evaluate the
                      recency, severity, and number of collection accounts.
                      Recent, numerous, or high-value collections may reduce
                      your approval odds or result in lower credit limits.

                      Mission Lane offers a pre-qualification tool that allows
                      you to check your approval odds without impacting your
                      credit score. The pre-qualification uses a soft credit
                      inquiry, which doesn't affect your credit score. You'll
                      see which card you pre-qualify for and your estimated
                      terms (APR, annual fee, credit limit). Pre-qualification
                      does not guarantee approval—final approval requires a
                      formal application and hard credit inquiry.

                      deposit equal to your credit line. Deposit amounts

                      creditworthiness and income. The deposit can be paid by
                      debit card, bank transfer, or money order. Your deposit is
                      refundable when you close the account in good standing or
                      upgrade to an unsecured card. The deposit is held in a

                      Mission Lane charges a variable Annual Percentage Rate
                      (APR) ranging from 19.99% to 33.99%, based on the Prime
                      Rate plus a margin determined by your creditworthiness.
                      The APR is variable, meaning it can change quarterly if
                      the Prime Rate changes. As of April 2025, the Prime Rate
                      is 7.5%, and Mission Lane adds a margin of 12.49% to
                      26.49% for purchases and cash advances. Your specific APR
                      depends on your credit profile, income, and debt-to-income
                      ratio. Applicants with better credit scores typically
                      receive lower APRs within the range.

                      fee will never exceed the minimum payment that was due.
                      Similarly, if your payment is returned unpaid by your
                      bank, you'll be charged a returned payment fee of $30

                      advance fee equal to the greater of $5 or 8% of each cash
                      advance amount. Cash advances also begin accruing interest
                      immediately with no grace period. For foreign transactions
                      (purchases made in foreign currencies or processed outside

                      A: Mission Lane generally accepts applicants with fair to

                      best for better credit (670+), the Green Line targets

                      A: Yes, Mission Lane may offer you an upgrade to the Green
                      Line or Silver Line card after you demonstrate responsible
                      use of the Secured card. Upgrades typically occur after
                      6-12 months of on-time payments and good account
                      management. When you upgrade, your security deposit is

                      if you proceed with a formal application, Mission Lane
                      will perform a hard credit inquiry, which may temporarily
                      lower your credit score by a few points.

                  If you are approved with an APR of 29.99% (variable) and carry
                  a balance of $1,000 for one year while making only minimum
                  payments, you would pay approximately $299.90 in interest
                  charges, assuming no additional purchases and a minimum
                  payment calculation of 1% of the balance plus interest and
                  fees. This example demonstrates the importance of paying your
                  balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.

                  <strong>Credit Score Impact Warning:</strong> Late payments,
                  missed payments, or other defaults on your account will be
                  reported to credit bureaus and will negatively impact your
                  credit score. A single late payment can remain on your credit
                  report for up to 7 years. High credit utilization (using more
                  than 30% of your credit limit) will also harm your credit
                  score. To maximize credit building benefits, always pay at
                  least the minimum payment on time and keep your balance low
                  relative to your credit limit.

                  <strong>Minimum Payment Warning:</strong> If you make only the
                  minimum payment each month, you will pay more in interest and
                  it will take longer to pay off your balance. For example, if
                  you have a $1,000 balance with a 29.99% APR and make only
                  minimum payments of 1% of the balance plus interest and fees
                  (minimum $25), it would take approximately 4-5 years to pay
                  off the balance and you would pay hundreds of dollars in
