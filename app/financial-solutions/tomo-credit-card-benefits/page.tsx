              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Tomo Credit Card breaks down traditional barriers by not
                requiring an existing credit history. Instead, it evaluates your
                financial stability based on your income and spending habits.
                This innovative approach makes it perfect for recent immigrants,
                international students, and anyone new to the credit system,
                providing a clear pathway to build a positive credit profile
                from scratch. It's about giving everyone a fair chance to prove
                their financial responsibility.

                benefit for a card designed for credit building. By using your
                Tomo Card for everyday expenses like groceries and
                transportation, especially with participating merchants, you can
                maximize your rewards while consistently building a positive
                payment history. It's a win-win: you save money and strengthen
                your credit.

                Tomo is committed to helping you achieve financial health
                without hidden costs. The card charges no annual fees and,

                or biweekly payment system that encourages timely payments and
                prevents debt accumulation. This model promotes responsible
                spending habits and ensures that the card remains affordable,
                allowing you to build credit without the burden of high-interest
                debt.

                Credit Limit Based on Income: Grow Responsibly
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Your Tomo Credit Card limit is determined by your income and
                financial activity, rather than your credit history. This
                personalized approach ensures your limit aligns with your
                capacity to spend responsibly. As you consistently use the card
                and make timely payments, your credit limit can gradually
                increase, supporting your credit-building journey within a safe
                and manageable range. It's a system designed for growth and
                financial empowerment.

                To get the most out of your Tomo Credit Card, consider these
                practical tips:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Set Reminders for Weekly Payments:</strong> Tomo's
                  payment structure requires regular, timely payments. Set up
                  reminders or enable auto-pay to ensure you never miss a
                  deadline, which is crucial for building a strong credit
                  history.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Use the Card for Essential Purchases:</strong>{" "}
                  Leverage the cashback rewards by using your Tomo Card for your
                  regular expenses, especially with partner vendors. This helps
                  you earn rewards on spending you'd do anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitor Your Spending:</strong> Since your credit
                  limit is tied to your income, keeping your spending within
                  reasonable limits can improve your chances of future credit
                  limit increases and demonstrate responsible financial
                  management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Track Your Credit Progress:</strong> Regularly check
                  your credit score to see the positive impact of your
                  responsible Tomo Card usage. Watching your score grow can be a
                  great motivator!
