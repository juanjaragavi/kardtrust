                  <strong>Credit Score:</strong> A good credit score (typically
                  above 650) generally increases your chances of approval. TD
                  Bank carefully considers your creditworthiness as part of the
                  application process.
                </li>

                  <strong>Proof of Income:</strong> You will need to provide
                  accurate income details to help TD Bank assess your ability to
                  manage credit payments responsibly. This ensures that the
                  credit limit provided aligns with your financial capacity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Security Number (SSN):</strong> An SSN is
                  required for identification and to facilitate necessary
                  financial background checks, ensuring compliance with
                  regulatory standards.

                <li>
                  <strong>Residential Address in the U.S.:</strong> Applicants
                  need to have a verified residential address within the United

                Understanding Interest Rates and Fees
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                To make an informed decision about the TD FlexPay Credit Card,
                here’s a look at some typical fees and interest rates:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR):</strong> The card offers
                  a competitive APR, which is determined based on the
                  applicant’s creditworthiness. This APR dictates how much
                  interest accumulates on any unpaid balances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Potential Annual Fees:</strong> While the card is
                  advertised as having no annual fee, it’s crucial to review the
                  specific terms and conditions of your offer, as some
                  cardholders may incur certain annual fees depending on their
                  credit profile or specific card features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Late Payment Fees:</strong> If payments are not made
                  on time, TD Bank may charge a late payment fee. Setting up
                  auto-payments or regular reminders can help you avoid these
                  extra charges and maintain a good payment history.
                </li>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitor Your Spending Regularly:</strong> Utilize TD
                  Bank’s account alerts and online tools to stay on top of your
                  spending and balance. This practice will help you identify
                  opportunities to repay more each month and keep your balances
                  in check.

                  <strong>Take Advantage of Promotions:</strong> TD Bank
                  occasionally runs special promotions for FlexPay cardholders.
                  Be on the lookout for these offers to earn extra rewards or
                  discounts on select purchases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Set Up Auto Payments to Avoid Fees:</strong> Late fees
                  can quickly add up. Setting up automatic payments or regular
                  reminders will help ensure your payments are always timely,

                  charges.
