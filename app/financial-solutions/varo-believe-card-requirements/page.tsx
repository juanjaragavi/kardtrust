                      No. Varo does not perform hard credit inquiries when you
                      apply for the Believe Card, so the application process
                      will not negatively impact your credit score. In fact,
                      Varo accepts any and all credit histories, including no
                      credit history at all.

                      Safe Pay is an optional feature that automatically pays
                      your credit card balance in full at the end of each
                      billing cycle using funds from your Varo Believe Secured
                      Account. While optional, it's highly recommended because
                      it eliminates the risk of missed payments. If you don't
                      enable Safe Pay, you'll need to manually pay your balance
                      each month to avoid late payment marks on your credit
                      report.

                      Results vary by individual, but Varo customers see an
                      average credit score increase of 40+ points after just 3
                      months of on-time payments. More than 90% of customers
                      with no credit score had one after using the card for just
                      one month, making it one of the fastest paths to
                      establishing credit in the US.

                  The Varo Believe Card has 0.00% APR with no interest charges.
                  In comparison, according to LendingTree, the average secured
                  credit card APR was 23.40% as of July 2024, with some cards
                  charging up to 29.74% variable APR. For example, if you
                  carried a $1,000 balance on a card with 28% APR for one year,
                  you could pay approximately $280 in interest. With Varo
                  Believe, you would pay $0 in interest on the same balance.
