              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                To qualify for the DoorDash Rewards Mastercard, applicants
                typically need to meet certain criteria. Understanding these
                requirements can help you prepare your application.
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit Score:</strong> Generally, a good credit score
                  (typically 680 or higher) will significantly improve your
                  chances of approval. While specific requirements may vary by
                  issuer, a strong credit history demonstrates your financial
                  responsibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Income Documentation:</strong> You will need to
                  confirm your income level to meet the card issuer's standards.
                  This helps them assess your ability to manage new credit. Be
                  prepared to provide documentation such as pay stubs or tax
                  returns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Identification:</strong> A valid Social Security
                  Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number
                  (ITIN) is required for identity verification. This is a
                  standard requirement for financial products in the U.S. to
                  ensure compliance with federal regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> Applicants must be at least
