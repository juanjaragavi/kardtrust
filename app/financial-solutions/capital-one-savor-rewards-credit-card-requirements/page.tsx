                Important Considerations Before Applying
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Before applying for the Capital One Savor Rewards Credit Card,

                for individuals who frequently dine out or spend on
                entertainment. If your spending is primarily in other categories

                different rewards cards.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Also, consider your credit score and financial situation.
                Capital One typically requires good to excellent credit, so
                ensure your credit profile meets their standards before
                applying.
