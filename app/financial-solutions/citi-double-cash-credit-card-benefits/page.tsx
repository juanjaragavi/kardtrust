                The Citi Double Cash Credit Card is ideal for those seeking
                simplicity and maximum cash-back rewards. Unlike cards with

                purchases and another 1% upon payment—covering everything from
                groceries to bills. With no annual fee and a generous
                introductory APR on balance transfers, it’s a clear, rewarding
                choice for everyday spending.

                How the Cash Back Works: Simple and Rewarding
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                One of the standout features of the Citi Double Cash Card is its
                unique and transparent cash-back structure. You don’t have to
                worry about quarterly sign-ups, rotating categories, or making
                specific purchases to earn high rewards. Here’s how it breaks
                down:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>1% When You Buy:</strong> On every dollar you spend,
                  you earn 1% cash back right away. This applies to all
                  purchases, giving you immediate value.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>1% When You Pay:</strong> The second 1% comes when you
                  make a payment towards your balance. This system not only
                  rewards you but also encourages responsible credit card
                  behavior, prompting you to pay off your balance regularly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>No Limit on Cash Back:</strong> You can continue
                  earning rewards no matter how much you spend, making it a
                  truly unlimited cash-back card.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                This system is perfect for those who use their credit card for a
                wide variety of purchases and prefer to avoid the complexities
                of other rewards programs. The Citi Double Cash Card ensures
                that every transaction, big or small, contributes to your
                savings.
              </p>

                Introductory APR on Balance Transfers: A Smart Way to Manage
                Debt
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                In addition to its impressive cash-back potential, the Citi
                Double Cash Credit Card offers a 0% introductory APR for 18
                months on balance transfers. This can be a significant advantage
                if you’re carrying a balance on another high-interest credit
                card. By transferring your balance, you can save substantially
                on interest charges, giving you a dedicated period to pay down
                your debt more efficiently. After the introductory period, the
                standard APR will apply, so it’s wise to maximize this offer
                within the initial window.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Keep in mind that a balance transfer fee (either 3% or $5,
                whichever is greater) applies. While the introductory APR can
                lead to substantial savings, always ensure the transfer fee
                doesn’t outweigh the benefits for your specific situation.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                No Annual Fee: Maximize Your Net Rewards
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Another significant perk of the Citi Double Cash Card is that it
                has no annual fee. Many rewards cards, especially those with
                generous cash-back programs, come with an annual fee that can
                reduce your net rewards. With this card, every dollar of cash
                back you earn is yours to keep. It’s a win-win, particularly for
                those who prefer to avoid paying to carry a credit card and want
                to maximize their savings.
              </p>

                Flexible Redemption Options: Your Rewards, Your Choice
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Citi offers flexible ways to redeem your rewards, giving you the
                freedom to choose what works best for your financial needs. Once
                you’ve accumulated at least $25 in cash back, you can redeem it
                in the following ways:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Statement Credit:</strong> Apply your cash back
                  directly to your card balance, reducing your outstanding
                  amount.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Direct Deposit:</strong> Transfer the money to a
                  linked Citi checking or savings account, or even to an account
                  at a different bank, providing easy access to your funds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Check:</strong> Receive your rewards in the form of a
                  physical check by mail, offering another convenient option.
                </li>
