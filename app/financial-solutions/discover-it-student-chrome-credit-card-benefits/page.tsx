                Designed with student lifestyles in mind, this card offers a
                rewarding cashback program that maximizes savings and supports
                responsible financial habits. It's a smart option for students
                starting their financial journey.

                2% Cashback on Restaurants and Gas Stations: Rewards on Everyday
                Spending
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                One of the standout features of the Discover it Student Chrome
                Credit Card is its 2% cashback on purchases made at restaurants
                and gas stations (on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each
                quarter). This makes it an ideal card for students who
                frequently dine out with friends or commute to campus. By
                earning rewards on these common expenses, students can enjoy
                significant savings on the money they’re already spending. Every
                time you grab a bite to eat or fill up your tank, you’re not
                just covering expenses—you’re earning a return. This focus on
                everyday spending categories encourages financial responsibility
                while rewarding practical, real-world purchases.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                1% Cashback on All Other Purchases: Every Dollar Counts
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                In addition to the 2% cashback on select categories, the
                Discover it Student Chrome Credit Card offers 1% cashback on all
                other purchases. This ensures that no matter what you
                buy—whether it’s school supplies, electronics, or
                entertainment—you’re earning rewards. For students managing a
                variety of expenses, sometimes unexpected ones, this feature is
                particularly valuable. Even small purchases add up over time,
                turning routine transactions into meaningful savings. With this
                card, every dollar spent contributes to your financial goals, no
                matter the type of purchase.

                No Annual Fees: Maximize Your Savings
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                One of the biggest advantages of the Discover it Student Chrome
                Credit Card is its no annual fee policy. For students working
                with tight budgets, this is a crucial benefit. By avoiding
                annual charges, cardholders can focus on maximizing their
                cashback rewards without worrying about additional costs. Every
                cent earned through the cashback program becomes real savings
                that can be used for personal expenses, trips, or emergencies.
                Eliminating this common fee makes the Discover it Student Chrome
                Credit Card a particularly student-friendly financial tool.

                Double Rewards in the First Year: An Unmissable Opportunity
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Discover it Student Chrome Credit Card offers an exclusive
                double rewards promotion for new cardholders. At the end of your
                first year, Discover will automatically match all the cashback
                you’ve earned. This means your 2% cashback effectively becomes
                4% on restaurants and gas stations, and your 1% cashback becomes
                2% on all other purchases. This introductory offer allows
                students to significantly maximize their savings in the first
                year of use, whether they’re shopping for back-to-school
                supplies, dining out, or traveling. It’s an excellent incentive
                to establish responsible credit habits while enjoying enhanced
                benefits.

                Why the Discover it Student Chrome Credit Card Stands Out
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Discover it Student Chrome Credit Card is packed with
                benefits that make it an excellent choice for students. From

                unique first-year cashback match, this card is designed to
                maximize savings while supporting financial education. Before
                applying, students should confirm they meet the basic
                eligibility criteria to ensure the card aligns with their needs.
                With its rewarding and practical features, this card is a
                valuable tool for any student starting their credit journey.
