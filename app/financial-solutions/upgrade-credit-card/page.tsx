                The Upgrade OneCard breaks the mold of traditional credit cards
                by combining the flexibility of a credit card with the
                predictability of a personal loan. With no annual fee, flexible
                payment options, and APRs ranging from 14.99% to 29.99%, you get
                the power to choose how and when to pay for your purchases—pay
                now to avoid interest or pay later with fixed installment terms.

                    Traditional credit cards with minimum payments can keep you

                    faster. For example, a $5,000 purchase at 23% APR would cost
                    $2,060.20 in interest over 3 years with Upgrade's fixed
                    payments versus $8,929.28 in interest over 23 years with
                    traditional minimum payments.

                  The Upgrade OneCard represents a fundamental reimagining of
                  how credit cards work. While traditional credit cards trap
                  consumers in cycles of minimum payments and accumulating
                  interest, Upgrade combines the convenience of a credit card
                  with the disciplined payoff structure of a personal loan. This
                  hybrid approach gives you the flexibility to use credit when
                  you need it while maintaining control over your repayment
                  timeline and interest costs.

                  How the Pay Now or Pay Later Feature Works
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Pay Now feature is what sets the Upgrade OneCard apart
                  from every other credit card on the market. When you make a
                  purchase, you can designate it as "Pay Now" and Upgrade will
                  automatically debit your linked bank account the day after the
                  transaction settles—completely eliminating interest charges on
                  that purchase. This is perfect for everyday expenses like
                  groceries, gas, or bills that you want to pay off immediately
                  while still earning credit card protections and building your
                  credit history.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Alternatively, you can designate purchases as "Pay Later" to
                  spread the cost over a fixed payment period with predictable
                  monthly installments. This gives you the flexibility of a
                  personal loan for larger purchases while maintaining the
                  convenience of a credit card. You can even change your mind—up
                  until 12pm Pacific Time the day after a transaction
                  settles—allowing you to switch between Pay Now and Pay Later
                  based on your cash flow situation.

                  Breaking Free from Minimum Payment Traps
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Traditional credit cards are designed to keep you in debt
                  through minimum payments that barely touch the principal
                  balance. Consider this comparison: If you have a $5,000
                  balance on a traditional credit card with 23% APR and make
                  only minimum payments starting at $145.83, you'll pay
                  $8,929.28 in interest over 23 years before paying off the
                  balance. That's nearly double the original amount.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  With the Upgrade OneCard's fixed installment structure, that
                  same $5,000 purchase would be paid off in just 36 months with
                  fixed payments of $196.13—totaling only $2,060.20 in interest.
                  You'll save $6,869.08 and be debt-free 20 years sooner. This
                  structure ensures you're making real progress on your balance
                  every month, not just treading water while interest
                  accumulates.

                  Flexible Credit Line Structure
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Upgrade OneCard operates as a series of closed-end loans
                  that you access through card transactions. Your initial credit
                  line is based on your creditworthiness, and as you make
                  payments and pay down your balance, additional credit becomes
                  available up to your approved amount. This is different from
                  traditional revolving credit that automatically replenishes—
                  with Upgrade, you must meet ongoing credit requirements to
                  access your remaining credit.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  This structure encourages responsible credit usage while still
                  providing flexibility for new purchases. Your interest rate
                  and available credit may be adjusted after the first 12 months
                  based on your credit score and market conditions, but the
                  interest rate on existing balances will never change—giving
                  you predictability for your current obligations while
                  maintaining market-based pricing for future transactions.

                  ATM Access with Pay Now Integration

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Upgrade OneCard is unique in offering optional ATM access
                  when you activate the "ATM Access" setting. All ATM
                  transactions are automatically treated as Pay Now purchases,
                  meaning they'll be paid off the day after they settle through
                  automatic debits from your linked bank account. This
                  eliminates the high interest charges typically associated with
                  credit card cash advances, though standard ATM withdrawal fees
                  may still apply depending on the ATM operator.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Without activating ATM Access, any ATM transaction requests
                  will be declined. This ensures you're making a conscious
                  decision about cash access and have the necessary funds in
                  your linked bank account to cover the automatic payoff.
