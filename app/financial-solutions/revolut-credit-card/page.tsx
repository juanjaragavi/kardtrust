                  The Revolut Credit Card represents a fundamental shift in how
                  credit cards work, combining traditional credit functionality
                  with cutting-edge fintech innovation. Available as either the
                  Revolut Visa Credit Card (issued by Cross River Bank) or the
                  Revolut Secured Mastercard (issued by Lead Bank), both options
                  integrate seamlessly with Revolut's comprehensive financial
                  ecosystem. This integration provides benefits far beyond what
                  traditional credit cards offer—including real-time spending
                  analytics, instant notifications, and advanced money
                  management tools all within a single app.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Unlike traditional credit cards managed through clunky
                  websites and monthly paper statements, the Revolut Credit Card
                  lives entirely within Revolut's intuitive mobile app. Every
                  transaction triggers an instant notification with merchant
                  details, spending category, and real-time balance updates.
                  View your spending broken down by category, set custom
                  budgets, and receive alerts when you're approaching limits.
                  This level of financial visibility helps you make better
                  spending decisions in real-time rather than discovering
                  problems weeks later on a statement.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Revolut Credit Card transforms international spending with
                  support for 150+ currencies and zero foreign transaction fees.
                  Traditional credit cards typically charge 3% on international
                  purchases, meaning a $1,000 vacation could cost an extra $30
                  in fees alone. Revolut eliminates these charges while
                  providing exchange rates at or near the interbank rate—the
                  same rate banks use when trading with each other. Whether
                  you're booking hotels in Europe, shopping from Asian
                  retailers, or paying for software from international
                  providers, you'll save money on every transaction while
                  enjoying the convenience of spending in local currencies.

                  Security is reimagined with the Revolut Credit Card through
                  innovative features designed for the digital age. Create

                  with unique numbers that regenerate after every purchase,
                  protecting your main card details from data breaches. Enable
                  location-based security to automatically decline transactions
                  made far from your phone's GPS location. Freeze and unfreeze
                  your card instantly if you misplace it, or set custom spending
                  limits for different transaction types (online purchases, ATM
                  withdrawals, contactless payments). Real-time fraud monitoring
                  combined with instant notifications means you'll know about
                  suspicious activity within seconds, not days or weeks later.
