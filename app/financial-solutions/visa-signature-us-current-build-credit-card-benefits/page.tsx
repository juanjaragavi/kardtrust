                No Fees or Hidden Charges: Save Money from Day One
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                One of the standout features of the Visa Signature U.S. Current
                Build is the absence of annual fees. This feature is extremely
                important, as many credit cards, especially those that offer
                rewards programs or additional benefits, tend to charge a
                maintenance fee. These fees can range from $50 to $100 or more
                annually, which can become a significant expense if you do not
                frequently use the card's benefits.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                With the Visa Signature U.S. Current Build, you can forget about
                these additional costs. There are no maintenance fees, allowing
                you to save money from the start. Moreover, this card does not
                apply hidden charges or surprise you with unexpected fees on
                your monthly bill. This is ideal for people who are beginning to
                manage their credit, as it allows them to focus on using their
                card responsibly without worrying about unexpected payments.

                rewards system that earns points on every purchase—groceries,
                dining, or online shopping. These points can be redeemed for
                discounts, card balance payments, or exclusive products, making
                it a valuable tool for maximizing everyday spending. For
                instance, spending $500 monthly can accumulate significant
                points, turning routine expenses into financial benefits.

                transactions, every dollar spent contributes to your rewards
                balance.
