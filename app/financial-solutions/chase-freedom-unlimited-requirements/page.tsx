                Key Requirements for the Chase Freedom Unlimited Credit Card
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                To apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited Credit Card, you
                generally need to meet the following criteria:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit Score:</strong> A good to excellent credit
                  score (typically 670 or higher) is generally recommended to
                  improve your chances of approval. A strong credit history
                  demonstrates your ability to manage credit responsibly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> Applicants must be at least
                  18 years old to apply for this credit card. This is a standard
                  requirement across most credit card issuers to comply with
                  legal and financial regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>U.S. Residency:</strong> The card is exclusively
                  available to U.S. residents, meaning you need a valid
                  residential address within the United States. If you do not
                  have a permanent address in the U.S., your application will
                  not be considered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Proof of Income:</strong> You will need to provide
                  accurate income details to help Chase assess your ability to
                  manage credit payments responsibly. This ensures that the
                  credit limit provided aligns with your financial capacity. Be
                  prepared to provide documentation such as pay stubs or tax
                  returns if requested.
                </li>
