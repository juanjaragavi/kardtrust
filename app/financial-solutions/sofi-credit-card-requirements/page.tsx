                      The SoFi Unlimited 2% Card is recommended for customers
                      with excellent credit. While SoFi doesn't publish a
                      specific minimum credit score, "excellent credit"
                      typically means a FICO score of 720 or higher. SoFi
                      evaluates multiple factors beyond your credit score to
                      determine eligibility.

                      A clean default history demonstrates financial

                      No. When you check for prequalified offers, SoFi conducts
                      only a soft credit inquiry that will not impact your
                      credit score. Your credit score will only be affected if
                      you apply for and are approved for a prequalified offer,
                      at which point SoFi will run a hard credit pull.

                      While SoFi doesn't publish a specific minimum credit
                      score, the Unlimited 2% Card is recommended for customers
                      with excellent credit, typically meaning a FICO score of
                      720 or higher. SoFi also considers factors beyond credit
                      score such as payment history, loan default history, and
                      recent credit behavior.

                      You can find out if you have a prequalified offer in
                      minutes. If you proceed with a full application, most
                      applicants receive a credit decision within minutes,
                      though some applications may require additional review.
                      Allow up to 30 days from date of submission for complete
