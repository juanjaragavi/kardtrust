                The Tomo Credit Card is designed to help individuals build or
                improve their credit without requiring a prior credit history.
                This makes it an ideal choice for newcomers to the credit
                system, such as recent graduates, immigrants, or those who
                haven’t used traditional credit products before.

                Requirements for the Tomo Card
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Applying for the Tomo Credit Card is straightforward, with clear
                requirements designed to make credit accessible.
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>No Credit History Required:</strong> One of the most
                  significant advantages of the Tomo card is that it doesn’t
                  require an existing credit history. Unlike most traditional
                  credit cards that rely on a credit check, Tomo allows
                  applicants to begin building their credit profile from
                  scratch. This opens doors for a wider audience, including
                  those new to the U.S. financial system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>U.S. Bank Account:</strong> Applicants must have an
                  active U.S. bank account. Tomo uses this account to evaluate
                  your financial stability by assessing your banking activity,
                  providing insight into your income consistency and spending
                  habits. This innovative approach helps Tomo determine your
                  financial responsibility without a traditional credit inquiry,
                  ensuring a fair assessment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Residency and Age:</strong> To apply for the Tomo
                  card, you must be at least 18 years old and have a valid
                  residential address in the United States. These are standard
                  requirements for financial products in the U.S., ensuring that
                  applicants are legally eligible to enter into financial
                  agreements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>SSN or ITIN:</strong> A Social Security Number (SSN)
                  or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is
                  required for identity verification. This helps Tomo comply
                  with federal regulations and verify your identity securely.
                  For those without an SSN, the ITIN option is particularly
                  useful, making the card accessible to non-U.S. citizens,
                  including international students and other residents.

                  <strong>Access the Official Website:</strong> Start by
                  visiting the official Tomo website. You'll complete a brief
                  online application form with your basic personal information.
                  The process is user-friendly and can be finished in just a few

                <li>
                  <strong>Provide Financial Information:</strong> Instead of a
                  traditional credit inquiry, Tomo assesses your financial
                  stability through your linked U.S. bank account. The card
                  issuer reviews your banking activity, focusing on factors like
                  deposits, spending patterns, and account balance trends. This
                  alternative method allows Tomo to understand your financial
                  responsibility without impacting your credit score.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Approval Process:</strong> After your financial
                  information is reviewed, Tomo's team will evaluate your
                  eligibility based on your banking activity. You'll typically
                  receive a decision within a few days. If approved, you can
                  quickly begin using the card to build your credit. This
                  efficient approval process is a key advantage, minimizing
                  waiting times for those eager to establish or improve their
                  credit.

                Why Choose the Tomo Card?
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Tomo Credit Card is an excellent choice for empowering
                individuals to build credit. It reports to major credit bureaus,
                which is essential for establishing a strong credit history.
                Responsible use, such as making timely payments and keeping
                balances low, can significantly boost your credit score over
                time. Plus, with no annual fees, it's an affordable option for
                starting your credit journey.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                To maximize the benefits and build a strong credit profile with
                your Tomo Card:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Make Timely Payments:</strong> Always pay your balance
                  on time. This is the most critical factor for building a
                  positive credit history and demonstrates your reliability to
                  lenders.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Keep Your Spending in Check:</strong> While consistent
                  use helps build credit, it's equally important to keep your
                  balance low relative to your credit limit. Avoid maxing out
                  your card to show responsible credit utilization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitor Your Credit Score:</strong> Since Tomo reports
                  to major credit bureaus, regularly checking your credit score
                  allows you to track your progress and stay informed about your
                  financial health.

                How Tomo Compares to Other Credit-Building Cards
              </h2>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Unlike secured credit cards, which require a security deposit,
                the Tomo card offers an unsecured line of credit, providing more
                convenience and flexibility. Many traditional cards for those
                with limited credit still perform a credit check, a step Tomo
                bypasses. This combination of no fees, no credit check, and
                comprehensive credit bureau reporting makes Tomo a highly
                competitive and accessible option for new credit users.

                Key Takeaways

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Tomo Credit Card is a practical and accessible solution for
                anyone looking to build or rebuild their credit. By evaluating
                your U.S. bank account activity instead of relying on a credit
                history, Tomo opens up credit opportunities to a broader
                audience. This card offers a chance to start fresh, cultivate
                financial responsibility, and access credit without the
                traditional barriers.
