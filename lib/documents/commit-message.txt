feat: Update favicon URLs to new KardTrust CDN paths and add brand documentation

FAVICON CDN MIGRATION:
- Updated all favicon references from /images/ to /images/kardtrust/ CDN path
- Modified favicon URLs in 7 core files: BRANDING.md, Preloader.tsx, blog-layout.tsx, logo.tsx, animated-image.tsx, mdx-components.tsx, next.config.mjs
- Added rewrites in next.config.mjs for favicon.png, favicon.ico, and apple-touch-icon.png to point to new CDN URLs
- Removed old TopFinanzas favicon files from /public/ directory (favicon.png, favicon.ico, favicon-16x16.ico, apple-touch-icon.png)

BRAND DOCUMENTATION:
- Created KARDTRUST_LOGOMARK_PROMPT.md with comprehensive brand identity analysis and AI image generation prompt
- Includes detailed brand personality, color specifications (#DC2626 red, #2563EB blue), visual concepts, and style guidelines
- Added 3 alternative short prompts optimized for AI image generation platforms (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- Created FAVICON_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md with complete testing checklist and rollback procedures

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed next.config.mjs rewrite configuration by removing invalid 'permanent' field (only valid for redirects, not rewrites)
- Resolved development server startup error preventing Next.js from running
- Cleared Next.js cache and verified clean server start

TESTING:
- Verified development server runs successfully on localhost:3005
- Confirmed middleware compilation and page routing working correctly
- Prepared testing checklist for favicon visibility across browsers and devices

NEXT PHASE:
- Phase 2 ready: header/footer logo updates to /images/kardtrust/ paths
- Logo URLs prepared: logo-english.webp and logo-white.webp
