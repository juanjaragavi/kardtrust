feat: Add upgrade credit card content and update blog/financial solutions pages

- Created new upgrade credit card article pages with comprehensive content
- Updated blog listing page with latest articles and improved filtering
- Enhanced credit cards page with new posts and better organization
- Updated CREDIT_CARD_PRODUCT_GENERATION.instructions.md to require external CTAs on requirements pages

Modified the financial product generation instructions to ensure that the final CTA button on requirements pages links to official external bank/product URLs instead of internal benefits pages. This change improves user experience by providing direct access to official application pages and includes proper implementation guidelines with target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" attributes for security.
- Improved layout with recent articles sidebar
- Updated favicon files for better branding consistency

This update expands the financial solutions content with valuable information about credit card upgrades and requirements.
