refactor: Standardize all image URLs to kardtrust subdirectory path

Completed migration of all image URLs from generic `/images/` and `/images/uk/` paths to the new centralized `/images/kardtrust/` subdirectory structure across the entire application.

Scope of Changes:
- Blog post metadata and page components (30+ files)
- Homepage featured posts and hero sections
- Personal finance article pages and featured images
- Navigation header and mega menu images
- Blog layout sidebar recent articles
- Documentation and optimization reports

This organizational change:
- Improves content organization and asset management
- Ensures consistent CDN path structure
- Enables better scalability for future image additions
- Maintains brand-specific asset separation on shared CDN

All images now use the pattern: media.topfinanzas.com/images/kardtrust/[filename].webp
- docs/PROMPT_BANNER_HOME_HERO.md (new)

Documentation system complete and ready for production image generation. All media URLs now follow KardTrust-specific naming convention for better asset organization.
