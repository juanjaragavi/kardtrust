feat: implement mandatory CTAs and optimize image placement across Financial Solutions benefit articles

CRITICAL MONETIZATION FIX:
- Add second CTA button (above-the-fold) to 8 benefit articles for improved conversion
- Relocate product images from bottom to top in DoorDash Rewards article
- Add missing product images to 3 articles (Wells Fargo, US Bank, Visa Current Build)

COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED:
- All 16 Financial Solutions benefit articles now have 2 CTAs linking to requirements pages
- First CTA visible above-the-fold on mobile for immediate user action
- Product images properly positioned at article top to prevent AdUnit Mob dominance
- 100% compliance with monetization requirements
