Fix legal pages text styling and improve readability

- Fixed illegible link colors: changed from light gray to blue (text-blue-600)
- Fixed light gray bold text: added .text-strong class with dark gray color
- Installed @tailwindcss/typography plugin to enable prose modifiers
- Increased h2 section heading size from 12px to 20px with bold weight
- Updated all legal pages (terms, privacy-policy, cookie-policy) with prose-strong modifier

This improves accessibility and readability across all legal documentation pages.
