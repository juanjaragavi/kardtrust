chore: Extract and prepare financial products data for injection

CHANGES:
- Created extract-products.js script
  * Automatically extracts financial product metadata from /app/financial-solutions/
  * Reads each product's page.tsx file
  * Extracts title, description, and keywords metadata
  * Infers product type (traditional/fintech/neobank)
  * Generates complete products array with 72 products

- Generated extracted-products.json
  * 72 complete financial products (main pages + requirements/benefits variants)
  * Includes all metadata, descriptions, and product type classifications
  * Ready for automated injection into allPosts arrays

- Created filter-main-products.js utility
  * Filters extracted products to only main product pages
  * Excludes -requirements and -benefits variants
  * Generates main-products-filtered.json with 20 main products
  * Produces main-products.ts.txt for TypeScript array injection

- Added supporting migration fix scripts
  * fix-jsx-comments.py - Fixes JSX comment syntax issues
  * fix-blockquotes.py - Removes blockquote symbols from migrated content
  * final-cleanup.py - Unwraps h3 tags from paragraph elements
  * final-cleanup-migration.sh - Shell-based comprehensive cleanup
  * fix-migrated-formatting.sh - Fixes markdown formatting issues
  * remove-unused-image-import.py - Removes unused Image imports

- Created inject-migrated-products.js
  * Injects products into allPosts arrays across page.tsx files
  * Formats products according to target page structure
  * Creates automatic backups before modifications
  * Prevents duplicate product injection
  * Comprehensive logging and error handling
