fix: Restore broken image URLs after UK migration

## Summary
Restored image URLs that were incorrectly modified during the UK-to-US migration. The media files on media.topfinanzas.com use specific naming conventions that must be preserved.

## Image URLs Restored (7 files)
- psychology-of-spending.webp → uk/the-psychology-of-spending-how-to-stop-impulse-buys-and-start-mindful-saving.webp
- top-rewards-credit-cards.webp → kardtrust/Top_Finance_uk_credit_cards.webp  
- online-loan-tips.webp → kardtrust/choosing-online-loan-uk.webp

## Files Modified
- app/page.tsx: 3 image references restored
- app/blog/page.tsx: 2 image references restored
- app/personal-finance/page.tsx: 2 image references restored
- app/personal-finance/psychology-of-spending/page.tsx: 3 image references restored
