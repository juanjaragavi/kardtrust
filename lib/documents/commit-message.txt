fix: Remove product pages from Personal Finance category listing

CRITICAL FIX: Personal Finance categorization error

- Removed 40+ credit card product entries from /app/personal-finance/page.txt
- Product pages were incorrectly listed with category "creditCards" 
- These products exist in /app/financial-solutions, not /app/personal-finance
- Kept only 23 legitimate educational/guide articles that actually exist in /app/personal-finance
- Fixes content categorization and prevents 404 errors for users
- Improves user experience, content discovery, and SEO
- Build tested and passes successfully

CHANGES:
- /app/personal-finance/page.tsx: Cleaned allPosts array to remove product-specific entries
- /docs/PERSONAL_FINANCE_CATEGORIZATION_FIX.md: Detailed documentation of the fix

IMPACT:
- Personal Finance category now correctly shows only educational content
- Product pages remain properly organized in Financial Solutions category
- All internal links now resolve correctly
- Better separation of content types for users
